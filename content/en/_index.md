We are a consulting company specializing in services related to
`data.table`, which is an R package that provides a high performance
database system. Our services include big data analysis, machine
learning, data visualization, and [teaching](/teaching/) specialized
programming classes related to these subjects.

[Who are we?](/contact/) We have 20+ years experience in statistical
programming and data science, and can show you how the efficiency of
`data.table` can be a critical part of your big data pipelines, to
optimize the use of finite computational resouces (time and
memory). In benchmarks, `data.table` can be 100x faster than other
software that provides similar functionality (base R, tidyverse,
python pandas, polars, arrow, duckdb, etc):

* [Slides: 3 hour `data.table` tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mHTFR6Eg7OdKi6yJcAvMk5_B8hjtMmsczs8Ewxt2xT8/edit?usp=sharing), including figures comparing timings with other R functions, `pandas`, `duckdb`, and `polars`.
* [Blog: code for comparing `data.table` with `pandas`, `duckdb`, and `polars`](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2024/pandas-dt/), in terms of CSV reading/writing and aggregation.
* [Blog: code for comparing `data.table` with base R, `dplyr`, `collapse`, and `arrow`](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2023/dt-atime-figures/), in terms of CSV reading/writing and aggregation.

  `polars`](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2024-10-17-duckdb_polars_reshape-toby_hocking/),
  in terms of functionality and speed for data reshaping operations
  (SQL PIVOT/UNPIVOT).
* [duckdb labs benchmark web
  page](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/): `data.table`
  consistently performs near the top in this database-like ops
  benchmark.
