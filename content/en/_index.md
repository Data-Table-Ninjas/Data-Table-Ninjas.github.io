We are a consulting company specializing in services related to
`data.table`, which is an R package that provides a high performance
database system. 
Our services include

* big data analysis, 
* machine learning, 
* data visualization,
* and teaching specialized programming classes related to these subjects.

We can show you how the efficiency of `data.table` can be a critical
part of your big data pipelines, to optimize the use of finite
computational resouces (time and memory). In benchmarks, `data.table`
can be 100x faster than other software that provides similar
functionality (R tidyverse, python pandas, polars, arrow, etc).
